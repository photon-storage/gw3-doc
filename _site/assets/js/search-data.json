    "content": "Gateway 3 is an unconventional IPFS portal. By offering a rich set of APIs and SDKs, it enables developers to gain accesses to the IPFS network with ease and to build products using IPFS swiftly. Unlike other providers, Gateway 3 no longer holds the concept of a node or dedicated gateway. As a result, developers are released from tracking usages and keeping up node capacity. They could instead focus on the products. The Gateway 3 scales automatically as more requests coming in and intelligently loads balance them to the globally distributed network. The unparalleled cloud-like experience, however, does not come with compromise on the data ownership. Gateway 3 is architected as a decentralized protocol from the beginning. An IPFS node with conforming Gateway 3 protocol can contribute to the portal network. Data uploaded to Gateway 3 is readily accessible from any IPFS peer. Full control of the data in intact. Sounds exciting? Letâ€™s get started. ",
