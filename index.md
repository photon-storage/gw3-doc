# Welcome to Gateway3

![welcome to Gateway3 docs](/assets/welcome.png)

[Gateway3](https://www.gw3.io) is an unconventional IPFS portal.
By offering a rich set of APIs and SDKs, it enables developers to gain accesses to the IPFS network with ease and to build products using IPFS swiftly.
Unlike other providers, Gateway3 no longer holds the concept of a **node** or **dedicated gateway**.
As a result, developers are released from tracking usages and keeping up node capacity.
They could instead focus on the products.
Gateway3 can scale as more requests coming in and intelligently loads balance them to the globally distributed network.

The unparalleled cloud-like experience, however, does not come with compromise on the data ownership.
Gateway3 is architected as a decentralized protocol from the beginning.
Any IPFS node with conforming Gateway3 protocol can contribute to the portal network.
Data uploaded to Gateway3 is readily accessible from any IPFS peer.
Full control of the data is intact.

Sounds exciting? Let's get started.

The remaining documentation breaks down into three sections:

* Firstly, the [getting started](/getting-started) section provides demos to play around.
This gets you started quickly on basic usages such as posting and retrieving data to/from the IPFS network.

* The [API](/api) section provides a list of supported Gateway3 APIs and their parameters.

* The [SDK](/sdk) section provides documentation for Javascript and Go SDKs. The SDK abstracts away the underlying plumbing works.
The SDK should satisfy the need for most developers.
More language supports are planned.
