# Welcome to Gateway 3

![welcome to Gateway3 docs](/assets/welcome.png)

[Gateway 3](https://www.gw3.io) is an unconventional IPFS portal.
By offering a rich set of APIs and SDKs, it enables developers to gain accesses to the IPFS network with ease and to build products using IPFS swiftly.
Unlike other providers, Gateway 3 no longer holds the concept of a **node** or **dedicated gateway**.
As a result, developers are released from tracking usages and keeping up node capacity.
They could instead focus on the products.
Gateway 3 can scale as more requests coming in and intelligently loads balance them to the globally distributed network.

The unparalleled cloud-like experience, however, does not come with compromise on the data ownership.
Gateway 3 is architected as a decentralized protocol from the beginning.
Any IPFS node with conforming Gateway 3 protocol can contribute to the portal network.
Data uploaded to Gateway 3 is readily accessible from any IPFS peer.
Full control of the data is intact.

Sounds exciting? Let's get started.

The remaining documentation breaks down into three sections:

* Firstly, the [getting started](/getting-started) section provides demos to play around.
This gets you started quickly on basic usages such as posting and retrieving data to IPFS network.

* The [API](/api) section provides a list of supported Gateway 3 APIs and their parameters.

* The [SDK](/sdk) section provides documentation for Javascript and Go SDKs. The SDK abstracts away the underlying plumbing works.
The SDK should satisfy the need for most developers.
More language support are planned.
